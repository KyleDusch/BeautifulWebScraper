# BeautifulWebScraper
Python based Web Scraper implemented using Beautiful Soup Package to scrape for recent news regarding a key word. In the example case being the word 'medicine'.

The main genesis of the project was to efficiently scrape a news source in order to provide myself and my colleagues at the fire station up to date articles in order to learn and discuss improvements to new medicines.
