# BeautifulWebScraper
Python based Web Scraper in Jupyter Notebooks implemented using Beautiful Soup Package to scrape for recent news regarding a key word. In the example case being the word 'medicine'. The data was scraped from Reuters.com.

The main genesis of the project was to efficiently scrape a news source in order to provide myself and my colleagues at the fire station up to date articles in order to learn and discuss improvements to new medicines. As part of the fire service, medicine is always evolving so utlizing modern tools to understand modern changes in medicine can then be discussed to our Physicians whom write the protocols and general orders which we follow in patient care.
